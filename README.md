CS Portfolio – Sprint Review and Retrospective
Project Deliverable

This repository contains my Sprint Review and Retrospective from the SNHU Travel Application project. The work demonstrates how Scrum roles, ceremonies, and artifacts were applied to guide the development process, encourage collaboration, and adapt to changing requirements. It highlights my ability to apply Agile practices in a real-world context to deliver value to stakeholders.

Reflection

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Understanding user needs begins with actively gathering requirements and identifying the real problems a user wants solved. To translate those needs into software, I use user stories, which describe the functionality from the user’s point of view. This approach keeps development focused on delivering value, ensures clarity, and provides testable outcomes. For example, framing requirements in terms of “As a user, I want to… so that I can…” makes it easier to guide design decisions and measure whether the solution is successful.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
When developing programs, I take an incremental and iterative approach, breaking work into smaller, manageable pieces that can be tested and adjusted quickly. Agile practices such as sprint planning, daily check-ins, and retrospectives help create rhythm and structure, while backlog refinement keeps priorities clear. Moving forward, I plan to incorporate automated testing, continuous integration, and stronger backlog management practices to make development cycles more efficient and adaptive.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being an effective team member means contributing not just through technical skills but also through collaboration, communication, and accountability. A good teammate is transparent about progress, raises issues early, and supports others when challenges arise. It also involves respecting diverse perspectives, participating in shared decision-making, and focusing on the success of the project as a whole rather than just individual tasks. Strong teamwork ensures smoother workflows and better outcomes for the end user.
